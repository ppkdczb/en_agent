This area of the Aegean Sea is <question_1> to earthquakes and tsunamis, which caused the city to gradually sink. The slow sea level rise in Mediterranean submerged this city <question_2> 3000 years ago. For millennia, the city's remains lay unseen <question_3> some 13 feet of water. They were covered by a thick layer of sand off the island of Laconia. In recent decades, <question_4> currents and climate change have eroded a natural barrier that protected Pavlopetri. In 1967 a scientific survey of the Peloponnesian coast was gathering data to <question_5> changes in sea levels when British oceanographer Nicholas Flemming first spotted the sunken structures. A year later, he <question_6> with a few students to examine the location and map the site. <question_7> the exciting initial finds, the site would lie undisturbed for decades before archaeologists would return. In 2009 archaeologists Chrysanthi Gallou and Jon Henderson resumed the excavation of Pavlopetri <question_8> with the Greek Ministry of Culture. Since the 1960s, underwater archaeology techniques and tools had made huge <question_9>. The team employed robotics, sonar mapping, and <question_10> graphics to survey the site. From 2009 to 2013 they were able to bring the underwater town to light. <question_11> about two and a half acres, Pavlopetri's three main roads crossed some 50 rectangular buildings, all of which had open courtyards. Excavations <question_12> a large number of Minoan-style loom weights, suggesting Pavlopetri was a thriving trade center with a <question_13> textile industry. This discovery <question_14> our understanding of trade networks. It <question_15> that Pavlopetri was a <question_16> hub connecting different cultures. However, the city's <question_17> underwater has also made it uniquely <question_18> to erosion. <question_19>, ongoing conservation efforts are crucial to preserve this invaluable site for future study.",
