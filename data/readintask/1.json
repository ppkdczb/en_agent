    "content": "Nearly 2,000 years ago, as the Romans began to pull out of Scotland, they leftbehind a curious treasure: 10 tons of nails, nearly a million of the things. The nail hoardwas discovered in 1960 in a four-metre-deep pit covered by two metres of gravel.Why had the Romans buried a million nails? The likely explanation is that thewithdrawal was rushed, and they didn't want the local Caledonians getting their handson 10 tons of weapon-grade iron. The Romans buried the nails so deep that they wouldnot be discovered for almost two millennia.\n Later civilisations would value the skilled blacksmith's labour in a nail even morethan the raw material. As Roma Agrawal explains in her new delightful book Nuts andBols, carly 17th-century Virginians would sometimes bur down their homes if theywere planning to relocate. This was an attempt to recover the valuable nails, whichcould be reused after sifting the ashes. The idea that one might burn down an entirehouse just to reclaim the nails underlines how scarce, costly and valuable thesimple-sceming technology was.\nThe price of nails fell by 90% between the late 1700s and mid-1900s, as economistDanicl Sichel points out in a research paper. According to Sichel, although the fallingprice of nails was driven partly by chcaper iron and cheaper energy, most of the creditgoes to nail manufacturers who simply found more cfficient ways to turm steel into nails.Nails themsclves have changed over the ycars, but Sichel studied them becausethey haven't changed much. Roman lamps and Roman chariots are very different fromLED strips and sports cars,but Roman nails are still clearly nails. It would be absurd totry to track the changing price of sports cars since 1695, but to ask the same question ofnails makes perfect sense.\n I make no apology for being obsessed by a particular feature of these objects: theirprice. I am an economist, after all. After writing two books about the history ofinventions, one thing I've leamt is that while it is the enchantingly sophisticatedtechnologies that get all the hype, it's the cheap technologies that change the world.The Gutenberg printing press transformed civilisation not by changing the nature ofwriting but by changing its cost-and it would have achieved little without a parallelcollapse in the price of surfaces to write on, thanks to an often-overlooked technologycalled paper. Solar panels had few niche uses until they became cheap; now they aretransforming the global energy system.",
