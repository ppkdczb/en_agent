"content": "I was shocked to learn recently that some scientists want to scale back their research in an effort to decrease carbon emissions. I discovered this when I was sitting on a panel discussing sustainable space activities and my colleagues’ concerns about their contribution to global warming was palpable. The crisis is here, they said, and we need to cut back on our energy intensive modelling. At the very least, we need to make our energy use far more sustainable.\n\nIt is unarguable that our laboratories, scientific instruments, rockets and satellites — the tools we scientists need to measure the planet’s pulse — demand significant amounts of energy both in their construction and operation. And it is equally true that science’s unrelenting appetite for information has caused a mushrooming of energy-intensive data centres around the world.\n\nHowever, this is a price we must pay for understanding the world. How can we inform decision makers about the best ways to bring down carbon emissions if we can’t track the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it’s coming from and who’s producing it? The carbon emissions from technological research are well spent: ultimately this research will safeguard the future of our planet.\n\nRecognising the hope that science and engineering can bring was the impetus behind the creation of the Millennium Technology Prize... Thanks to innovations like modern solar panels, we have a real chance to decrease the world’s carbon emissions.\n\nA great example is Europe’s largest supercomputer, LUMI in Finland... It is powered by a nearby river and its remote heat warms the surrounding town of Kajaani. If the world is to meet its net-zero ambitions, we must think hard about how we can deliver sustainable computing and deliver more LUMIs.",

"content": "Ever since taking on Netflix Inc at its own game, old Hollywood has struggled to turn a profit in streaming... But the age of streaming has been a boon for some unintended winners: pirates that use software to rip a film or television show in seconds from legitimate online video platforms and host the titles on their own, illegitimate services, which rake in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.\n\nWith no video production costs, illegal streaming sites have achieved profit margins approaching 90%, according to the Motion Picture Association (MPA)...\n\nInitially the rise of legitimate online businesses such as Netflix actually helped curb digital piracy... But now piracy involving illegal streaming services as well as file-sharing costs the US economy about $30 billion in lost revenue a year and some 250,000 jobs... The global impact is about $71 billion annually.\n\nRivkin joined the MPA in 2017... In 2017 the association formed the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE)... ACE says it's helped shrink the number of illegal streaming services in North America...\n\nParks Associates predicts legitimate US streaming services’ cumulative loss from piracy since 2022 will reach $113 billion... piracy may begin to plateau by 2027, but there is no consensus on when it may begin to decline, says analyst Steve Hawley.",

Because they are still here, decades, and they are tangible.\n\nHave you pondered the life cycle of intangible formats, digital information... The thing itself is the medium that delivers the information... Libraries and archives have traditionally shouldered the responsibility of organization, preservation, and access to information...\n\nWhen it comes to born-digital information, the terrifying answer can be: if not librarians and archivists, then no one. Digital information requires a great deal more care than analog.\n\nEven when a digital object is preserved, it may only be the carrier that’s saved... As technology advances and a format becomes obsolete, the object is useless... Without constant migration of digital assets... a historical record that abrupt stops when digital assets replaces analog.\n\nYet researchers can take some comfort... librarians are devoted to discovering, organizing, and preserving digital information... future researchers may find the digital realm challenging, but not impossible.",
