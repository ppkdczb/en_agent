          "For Q19, the wording 'paradox' could be slightly refined. The passage describes a consequence (overload) more than a strict logical paradox. Consider rephrasing to 'What problem arises from universal digital access according to the text?'",
          "Option D for Q16 ('Analog information is easier to authenticate') is not directly discussed in the passage (authentication is mentioned only for digital threats). While it might be inferred, it's not explicitly highlighted as a 'fundamental difference' in the passage, making it a weak distractor. Consider replacing it with an option more grounded in the text.",
          "The passage is rich and slightly complex. Consider adding one more inference-based question to better differentiate high-level comprehension."
