Consider rewording the option to more closely mirror the passage's language (e.g., 'more efficient manufacturing methods') to strengthen grounding. 2. Option C in Question 22 ('contrast the attitudes...') is weak and could be improved to be a more plausible distractor. 3. Minor typo in passage: 'carly' should be 'early', 'chcaper' should be 'cheaper', 'turm' should be 'turn', 'themsclves' should be 'themselves'."
