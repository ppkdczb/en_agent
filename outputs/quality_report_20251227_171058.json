          "Question 3: The passage says 'most of the credit goes to nail manufacturers who simply found more efficient ways to turn steel into nails.' While this strongly implies increased productivity, the phrase 'increased productivity' is not explicitly stated. Consider rewording the question or options to more directly mirror the passage's wording (e.g., 'more efficient manufacturing methods'). 2. Minor typos in passage: 'carly' (early), 'chcaper' (cheaper), 'turm' (turn), 'themsclves' (themselves). Proofreading recommended. 3. Overall difficulty is moderate",
          "could add one slightly more challenging inference question to better differentiate high-level students."
